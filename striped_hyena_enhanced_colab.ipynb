        "## 2. StripedHyena Architecture Overview <a name=\"architecture\"></a>\n",
        "\n",
        "The StripedHyena architecture, developed by Liquid AI, is a hybrid neural network architecture that combines rotary (grouped) attention with gated convolutions. This section provides a detailed explanation of the architecture and its components.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.1 Key Components of StripedHyena\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Rotary Positional Embeddings\n",
        "Rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) encode spatial information, allowing the model to understand the relative positions of features in both content and style images. This is crucial for maintaining spatial coherence in the stylized output.\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "def apply_rotary_embeddings(x, freqs):\n",
        "    # x: [batch, seq_len, dim]\n",
        "    # freqs: [seq_len, dim/2]\n",
        "    seq_len = x.shape[1]\n",
        "    x_complex = torch.view_as_complex(x.float().reshape(*x.shape[:-1], -1, 2))\n",
        "    freqs = freqs[:seq_len]\n",
        "    freqs = torch.view_as_complex(freqs.reshape(*freqs.shape[:-1], -1, 2))\n",
        "    x_rotated = x_complex * freqs\n",
        "    x_rotated = torch.view_as_real(x_rotated).flatten(-2)\n",
        "    return x_rotated.type_as(x)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Gated Convolutions\n",
        "The architecture employs gated convolutions that adaptively control information flow, allowing the model to selectively apply style features based on content characteristics. This results in more natural-looking style transfers that preserve important content details.\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "class GatedConv2d(nn.Module):\n",
        "    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, stride=1, padding=0):\n",
        "        super().__init__()\n",
        "        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels*2, kernel_size, stride, padding)\n",
        "        \n",
        "    def forward(self, x):\n",
        "        # Split channels into two parts\n",
        "        h = self.conv(x)\n",
        "        a, b = torch.chunk(h, 2, dim=1)\n",
        "        # Apply gating mechanism\n",
        "        return a * torch.sigmoid(b)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Hybrid Attention Mechanism\n",
        "StripedHyena combines local processing (through convolutions) with global context awareness (through attention mechanisms), creating a hybrid approach that captures both fine details and overall style patterns. This hybrid design is particularly effective for style transfer tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.2 Advantages for Neural Style Transfer\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Memory Efficiency**: Processes high-resolution images with significantly lower memory requirements than traditional Transformer models.\n",
        "2. **Linear Scaling**: Computational complexity scales linearly with image size instead of quadratically.\n",
        "3. **Long-range Dependencies**: Efficiently captures relationships between distant parts of the image.\n",
        "4. **Adaptive Processing**: Intelligently applies style based on content characteristics.\n",
        "5. **TPU Compatibility**: Architecture is well-suited for TPU acceleration.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.3 Adaptation for 2D Images\n",
        "\n",
        "The original StripedHyena architecture was designed for 1D sequence processing. For neural style transfer, we adapt it to 2D image processing by:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Converting 2D images to sequences by flattening spatial dimensions\n",
        "2. Applying StripedHyena processing\n",
        "3. Reshaping back to 2D for convolutional processing\n",
        "4. Using skip connections to preserve spatial information\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach allows us to leverage the strengths of the StripedHyena architecture while maintaining the spatial structure necessary for image processing."
